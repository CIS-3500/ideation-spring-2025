Chrome Extension Idea: Recipe Aggregator

Authors

Problem Statement

Many cooking and baking enthusiasts find online recipe websites cluttered with ads, pop-ups, long anecdotes, and unnecessary formatting. This makes it frustrating to extract the actual recipe content for personal use, especially when someone wants to save it for later or print it out. These distractions hinder the cooking process and can lead to errors or wasted time. Our Chrome Extension solves this problem by automatically parsing recipe webpages and extracting only the relevant information: ingredients, steps, time, and notes—presented in a clean, standardized format.

Target Audience

The primary audience for this extension is home bakers and cooks who frequently search for recipes online and want an easy way to save, organize, and print them. This includes hobbyist bakers, meal preppers, busy parents, culinary students, and even food bloggers who often work with multiple recipes. They value clarity, efficiency, and customization in the way they manage recipe content.
