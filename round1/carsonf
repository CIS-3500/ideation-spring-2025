# Chrome Extension Idea: **MapReviews**

## Authors

## Problem Statement  
Google Maps reviews for restaurants, attractions, and businesses can number in the thousands, making it overwhelming and time-consuming to read through them all. While AI could summarize them effectively, there is currently no easy way to copy or compile all reviews from a Google Maps location. This extension will solve that problem by providing a seamless way to extract and compile reviews for use with AI tools.

## Target Audience  
- People exploring new restaurants, stores, or local businesses via Google Maps  
- Tourists planning their itineraries based on local reviews  
- Busy people who want quick insights without reading hundreds of reviews  
- Anyone who values community feedback when choosing where to go

## Description  
This Chrome extension integrates with **Google Maps** and enables users to **scrape and compile all visible reviews** for a selected location with a single click. The collected reviews are then displayed in a clean, copyable format, ready to be pasted into an AI chatbot for summarization or sentiment analysis. This empowers users to quickly grasp the consensus without skimming endless comments.

## Selling Points  
1. **Saves time** by eliminating the need to scroll and read every review  
2. **Saves Reading** Allows reviews to be summarized  
3. **Consistent Formatting** standardizes review formats so they are easier to read 
4. **Supports informed decisions**, especially in new or unfamiliar locations  

## User Stories  
- As a traveler, I want to quickly understand if a local spot is worth visiting based on community reviews, so I can make the most of my trip.  
- As a busy professional, I want to get a quick AI-generated summary of reviews so I don’t waste time digging for key information.  
- As a picky eater, I want to find specific reviews mentioning dietary restrictions or preferences, so I can avoid unpleasant surprises.  
- As someone who leaves reviews, I want my contributions to matter and be part of meaningful summaries, not buried in the feed.

## Notes  
The biggest challenge will be determining how many reviews can reasonably be scraped per request, considering Google’s pagination and dynamic loading.
