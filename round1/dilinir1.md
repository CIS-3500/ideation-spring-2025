Problem Statement
LeetCode users often face challenges in quickly identifying logical errors, optimizing code, or understanding complex algorithm problems. While coding, users may want instant feedback to improve their solutions but don't have an easy way to get structured feedback without leaving the platform. Manually copying and pasting code into a separate tool or asking for feedback is time-consuming. The extension addresses these pain points by providing automated feedback directly from GPT without needing to leave the LeetCode environment.

Target Audience
Primary Audience: Developers and coders using LeetCode for learning, practice, or interview preparation.

Secondary Audience: Students, professionals, and anyone preparing for technical coding interviews or looking for coding solutions and feedback in real time.

Characteristics: Tech-savvy, primarily working with coding platforms, eager to improve coding skills or problem-solving abilities, and looking for efficient, time-saving tools to enhance their coding workflow.

Description
LeetGPT is a Chrome extension designed to provide real-time, AI-powered feedback on code written within the LeetCode editor. By extracting the code and problem description directly from LeetCode, users can toggle the type of feedback they want (e.g., bug detection, optimization suggestions, code explanation, etc.) and receive GPT-generated feedback with the click of a button — all without ever leaving the platform.

Selling Points
Instant Code Feedback: Get real-time analysis and suggestions without leaving the LeetCode editor.

Personalized Feedback Options: Choose the type of feedback you want — from bug detection to alternative solutions — all customized based on the user’s needs.

Seamless Integration: Automatically extract code and problem data from LeetCode, making the feedback process simple and efficient.

Multi-language Support: Supports various programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++, etc.), adjusting feedback based on the code's language.

User History & Saved Sessions: Save and revisit previous queries and feedback to track your progress over time.

User Stories
Round 1 (5 User Stories)

As a developer, I want to receive detailed feedback on my code directly from GPT, so that I can improve it without leaving the LeetCode editor.

As a student, I want to choose the type of feedback I receive (e.g., bug detection, performance optimization), so that I can get targeted advice based on my current needs.

As a coder preparing for interviews, I want to receive suggestions for edge cases and test cases, so that I can ensure my solution works under all conditions.

As a beginner, I want to have a simple, clean interface that doesn’t distract me from my coding task, so that I can focus on coding and improving my skills.

As a user, I want to be able to save and review my past feedback, so that I can track my improvement over time.

Round 2 (10 User Stories)

As a developer, I want to query GPT without having to manually copy and paste code, so that I can save time and improve efficiency.

As a learner, I want to get suggestions on alternative approaches to solve coding problems, so that I can learn different techniques.

As a coder, I want to adjust the tone and complexity of the feedback based on the problem's difficulty, so that the advice is more appropriate for my skill level.

As a user, I want to receive feedback that includes recommendations for improving code readability and best practices, so that my solutions are cleaner and easier to understand.

As a professional, I want to get performance and space complexity optimizations, so that my code is more efficient.

As a user, I want to choose which parts of my code to submit for feedback (e.g., the main function, helper functions), so that I can focus on specific areas.

As a user, I want to get a quick summary of what’s wrong with my code, so that I can make changes faster.

As a user, I want to easily toggle between different programming languages in my code, so that I can get more accurate feedback for multi-language problems.

As a user, I want to query GPT in a single click, so that the process is fast and efficient.

As a user, I want to have access to a timer or productivity feature, so that I can track how much time I spend on each problem and manage my coding challenges better.

Round 3 (15 User Stories)

As a user, I want to have the option to export my feedback in text or PDF format, so that I can refer to it later or share it with others.

As a user, I want to see syntax-highlighted code in feedback responses, so that I can easily distinguish between suggestions and the original code.

As a user, I want to get GPT feedback based on the difficulty level of the problem, so that I get an appropriate amount of guidance.

As a user, I want to have an option to refine my feedback requests by re-submitting with added instructions, so that I can fine-tune the response I get.

As a user, I want to view feedback in an inline pop-up, so that I don’t have to switch tabs or leave the editor.

As a user, I want to integrate the tool with my LeetCode account, so that I can directly access and track my history.

As a user, I want to get alerts for common mistakes and errors in my code, so that I can learn and improve more quickly.

As a user, I want to easily share my improved code or feedback with others via a link or social media, so that I can collaborate with peers.

As a user, I want to receive feedback suggestions even on edge cases, so that I can handle all test scenarios.

As a user, I want to have a feature that explains difficult concepts or algorithms, so that I can understand the solution better.

Notes
Challenges: Maintaining a lightweight extension while processing large code inputs might be a challenge. Efficient handling of large code blocks and GPT API token limits should be prioritized.

Alternative Approach: If the LeetCode API allows, consider directly integrating GPT feedback within the LeetCode interface, instead of a Chrome extension.

Feature Priority: Focus on core features like feedback generation and seamless code extraction first, then move on to the more complex features like user history or advanced settings.
