## User Stories

1. As a stressed-out student, I want to see only uplifting news articles so that I can feel more motivated and less anxious while catching up on current events.
2. As a working professional, I want to filter out news containing certain trigger words (e.g., “violence,” “war”) so that I can focus on the news that won’t affect my mental well-being during a busy day.
3. As a casual reader, I want to extract all headlines from a news site in one click so that I don’t have to scroll through cluttered websites to find interesting stories.
4. As an emotionally sensitive user, I want to sort news by emotional tone (e.g., happy, hopeful, neutral) so that I can control how I feel after reading the news.

## References & Inspiration

I was partially inspired by HW2 Daily Pennsylvanian scraper but also from personal experience since I feel that recent news have been stressful and depressing, and sometimes I just want to read news that can make me smile.
