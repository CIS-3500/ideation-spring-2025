Recipe scraper

Overview  
The Recipe Scraper & Simplifier is a Chrome extension designed to instantly extract, clean, and reformat recipes from cluttered cooking websites. It removes ads, long backstories, and unnecessary fluff, presenting users with a clean, standardized recipe card that’s easy to read, save, or print. Optionally, it can also convert recipes to vegan/vegetarian by substituting ingredients or adjust serving size and ingredient quantities to reflect new serving size.

Problem It Solves  
Annoying Bloat: Recipe sites are filled with ads, pop-ups, and lengthy personal stories before the actual recipe.

Inconsistent Formats: Recipes vary in structure (ingredients first vs. instructions first), making them hard to scan.

Dietary Adjustments: Manually converting recipes to vegan/vegetarian is time-consuming.

Key Features  
Instantly pulls recipe details (ingredients, steps, cook time) from any supported site.  
Displays just the essential info in a clean, printable card format.  
Option to auto-convert recipes to vegan/vegetarian (e.g., swaps butter → coconut oil, chicken → tofu).  
Creates a quick checklist of ingredients to buy.

How It Works  
User visits a recipe website (e.g., AllRecipes, Bon Appétit, Food Network).

Clicks the extension icon → the tool scans the page for recipe data.

Displays a clean, structured version with Title, servings(adjustable) , cook time, ingredients (with optional substitutions), step-by-step instructions

Why This Stands Out  
Faster than Manual Copying – No more scrolling through life stories to find the recipe.

Better than Bookmarking – Extracted recipes won’t disappear if the site goes down.

Helps Dietary Needs – Simplifies adapting recipes for vegans/vegetarians.
