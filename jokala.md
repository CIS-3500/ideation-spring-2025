## Authors

## Problem Statement  
Job seekers, especially students and recent grads, spend countless hours manually reaching out to potential mentors, alumni, or recruiters through LinkedIn and email. This process typically involves finding emails using tools like Apollo, storing them in spreadsheets, and then manually customizing each message. It's repetitive, time-consuming, and often inefficient.  
Smart Cold Outreach Assistant streamlines this workflow by integrating directly with LinkedIn and Apollo, auto-generating personalized messages using a stored user profile and sending them instantly — all within the browser.

## Target Audience  
- Undergraduate and graduate students looking for internships or jobs  
- International students seeking to connect with alumni from their home country, city, or school  
- Early-career professionals interested in mentorship or referrals  
- Job seekers targeting specific companies and recruiters through direct cold messaging  

## Description  
Smart Cold Outreach Assistant (SCOA) is a Chrome extension that automates and personalizes cold outreach messages on LinkedIn using LLMs like GPT-4. It pulls contact data via Apollo and enables users to one-click generate and send customized messages using a saved personal profile, without needing spreadsheets or manual editing.

## Selling Points  
- One-click message generation and sending from LinkedIn profiles  
- Integration with Apollo for automatic email discovery  
- Personalized templates powered by stored user context and LLMs  
- Efficient outreach for networking, referrals, and job applications  
- User-friendly interface designed for job-seeking students and professionals  

## User Stories  
1. As a student seeking internships, I want to send personalized outreach messages quickly so that I can contact more people efficiently.  
2. As an international student, I want to connect with alumni from my home country so that I can get culturally relevant advice.  
3. As a job applicant, I want to follow up with recruiters on LinkedIn with a click so that I don’t lose momentum in my job hunt.  
4. As a user, I want to store my personal context (school, major, interests) so that the extension can personalize messages for me.  
5. As a user, I want to choose from different message types (e.g., referral request, advice ask) so that the tone and content match my goals.  

## Notes  
- The biggest challenge is complying with LinkedIn and Apollo’s Terms of Service. Depending on limitations, we may need to use browser automation rather than APIs.  
- Future iterations could include reply tracking, follow-up reminders, and metrics on which messages perform best.  
- The idea could scale to startup outreach, sales prospecting, or nonprofit networking.  
- Customization could include tone settings (formal/informal), preferred length, or platform-specific tweaks (LinkedIn vs. email).
