# Chrome Extension Idea: Discord Ticket Extractor

## Authors

Cecilia Zhang, Garrett Kirsch

## Problem Statement

Many Discord servers use ticketing systems to handle support requests, reports, or feedback. These tickets often generate long transcripts that are hard to parse or extract useful insights from. Users often have to scroll through cluttered messages to identify key details after transcripts.

Server admins, moderators, and community managers need a better way to generate concise summaries of ticket conversations for reporting, documentation, or follow-up actions. This extension solves that gap by allowing users to extract and immediately summarize ticket content using LLMs like ChatGPT.

## Target Audience

- Support moderators and admins who regularly handle Discord ticket transcripts and want faster ways to summarize or review them using LLMs.

- Community managers who need to extract insights or trends from support tickets without reading through full HTML transcripts.

- Content or product teams who receive Discord ticket logs and want to streamline bug reports, feature requests, or user feedback into actionable summaries.

- Community members who want to save, reflect on, or better understand the content of their ticket conversations.

## Description

This Chrome extension is designed for Discord ticket transcripts. It cleans up the exported transcript to remove clutter, system messages, or bot formatting, allowing users to easily copy and paste the conversation texts into LLMs for summaries, insights, or streamlined follow-up actions.

## Selling Points

1. Quick installation, and no login required. Just open the script file in a browser and click to extract.
2. Clean formatting optimized for LLM input or archiving.
3. Filters out non-essential system/bot messages and emotes.
4. Focused on Ticket Tool Bot's transcript format for high compatibility.
5. Lightweight and privacy-safe (runs fully in-browser).

2. As a support moderator, I want to generate a clear, short title for each ticket so that I can label it quickly and consistently.
3. As a moderator, I want to redact sensitive user data before copying ticket content into an LLM so that I maintain privacy compliance.
4. As a new support moderator, I want to learn from previous tickets so that I can train myself on standard responses.

### Admins / Leads / Founders

1. As a server admin, I want to archive and organize ticket transcripts so that I can reference them later in case of disputes.

### Community Managers

### Community Members

2. As a community member, I want to summarize my interaction with moderators so that I can reflect on the situation or share it with someone I trust.
3. As a community member, I want to download a summary of my support ticket so that I can keep a record of what steps were taken to help me.

## Notes

Could optionally add a "highlight important messages" feature using keyword detection.

Phase 1 is limited to working with transcript files generated by Ticket Tool bots. It does not support live Discord chats or DM-based ticket flows.
