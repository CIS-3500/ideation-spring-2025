Problem Statement
Researchers and professionals often sift through countless web articles and journals, manually copying, organizing, and citing key quotes and evidence. This process is tedious, error-prone, and fragmented across multiple tabs and note apps. QuoteKeeper streamlines web research by letting users highlight text in-page, automatically storing quotes with their source URLs, and later generating an aggregated prompt for an LLM to analyze—all without leaving the browser.

Target Audience
Graduate students writing literature reviews

Academic researchers gathering evidence for papers

Journalists compiling quotes and sources

Analysts conducting market or policy research

Anyone who frequently reads and annotates long-form web content

Description
QuoteKeeper is a Chrome extension that lets you highlight passages on any web page and instantly saves them (with URL, title, and timestamp) to a project sidebar. When you’ve finished gathering evidence, click “Generate Prompt” to assemble all your quotes into a single LLM-ready request—automatically synthesizing your annotations, summaries, or thematic insights.

Selling Points
One-Click Highlighting: Save quotes and their metadata instantly, without switching applications.

Organized Sidebar Dashboard: View, tag, and search all collected highlights grouped by project.

LLM-Ready Prompt Generation: Automatically compile your quotes into a structured prompt for ChatGPT or other LLMs.

Local-First & Privacy-Respecting: All data is stored in your browser; no cloud upload unless you choose to.

Flexible Export Options: Export highlights and notes as JSON, Markdown, or CSV for seamless integration with other tools.

User Stories
As a graduate student, I want to highlight key sentences on a journal website so that I can save them with source citations for my thesis.

As a researcher, I want to tag highlights with custom labels (e.g. “Method,” “Result”) so that I can filter evidence by theme later.

As a journalist, I want to compile all my quotes into a single prompt so that an AI can help draft an article outline.

As an analyst, I want to search my saved highlights across multiple web domains so that I can quickly find relevant data.

As a thesis advisor, I want my students’ highlights exported in Markdown so that they can embed them directly into their drafts.

Notes
Challenge: Ensuring robust highlight detection on dynamically loaded pages (e.g. infinite scroll).

Alternative: Integrate with browser’s built-in “reading mode” to stabilize text selection.

Future Feature: Collaborative “shared project” mode where teams can pool and comment on highlights.
